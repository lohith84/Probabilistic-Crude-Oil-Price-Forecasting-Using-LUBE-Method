# Probabilistic Crude Oil Price Forecasting Using LUBE Method

## Overview

This project implements a probabilistic forecasting model for crude oil prices using the LUBE (Lower Upper Bound Estimation) method. The goal is to predict future oil prices with a high degree of accuracy by leveraging optimized deep learning models and statistical techniques.

## Highlights

- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Utilizes advanced statistical and deep learning models to forecast oil prices.
- **LUBE Method**: Implements the Lower Upper Bound Estimation technique.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Includes various deep learning models such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), BiLSTM (Bidirectional LSTM), CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit).
- **Interval Predictions**: Predicts the intervals in which future prices of crude oil may fall into.
- **Interval Forecasts**: Draws interval forecasts of crude oil prices on different time scales, including monthly, weekly, and daily.
- **Data Handling**: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation
